### Why Node.js/Express?
                     `Node version used:    v15.2.0`
- There are a lot of ready and useful Npm modules to work with pure HTTP(s), REST API, Web Services, etc that can be used both to construct API and to implement interaction with existing applications.
- Can reuse and share the code between the frontend and the backend parts of the application if needed.
- JavaScript is the most popular programming language, so the codebase will be easier to understand.
- The capability of the Node to handle multiple requests with low response times makes it a good fit when we consider a multi-user environment.

### Alternatives Considered
                                   `ASP .NET`
- Asp.Net Web API supports various MVC features such as routing, controllers, action results, filter, model binders, IOC container or dependency injection that makes it more simple and robust and easy to develop.

### If I were to spend more time on this task:
- Implement JWT-Based, Stateless Authentication.
- Ð¡reate a security checklist to minimize the possibility of SQL injection.
- Allow filtering, sorting, and pagination.
